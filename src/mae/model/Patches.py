"""This script defines a custom Keras layer for extracting patches from images.

The layer creates patches from the input images and returns the patches reshaped
into (batch, num_patches, patch_area) for use in neural network training.

Classes:
    Patches: A custom Keras layer for extracting patches from images.

Methods:
    call: Extracts patches from the input images and returns the patches reshaped.
    show_patched_image: A utility function that helps visualize one image and its
        patches side by side.
    reconstruct_from_patch: A utility function that takes patches from a single
        image and reconstructs it back into the image.

Example usage:
    # Create a Patches layer with a patch size of (16, 16).
    patches_layer = Patches(patch_size=(16, 16))

    # Pass a batch of images through the layer to extract patches.
    images = tf.random.normal((32, 256, 256, 3))
    patches = patches_layer(images)

    # Visualize a random image and its patches.
    patches_layer.show_patched_image(images, patches)

    # Reconstruct the original image from a single patch.
    patch = patches[0, 0]
    reconstructed = patches_layer.reconstruct_from_patch(patch)
